# PSVL

ICCV 2021 (to appear)

We first propose a novel task of zero-shot natural language video localization. 
The proposed task setup does not require any paired annotation cost for NLVL task but only requires easily available text corpora, off-the-shelf object detector, and a collection of videos to localize.
To address the task, we propose a pseudo-supervised NLVL method, called PSVL, that can generate pseudo-supervision for training an NLVL model.
Benchmarked on two widely used NLVL datasets, the proposed method exhibits competitive performance and performs on par or outperforms the models trained with stronger supervision.
